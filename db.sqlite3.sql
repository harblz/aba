<p><u>For Example...</u></p>

<ul style="margin-left:160px">
	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>first stimulus</strong> elicits some reflex (i.e., salivating, an increased heart beat, a startle response) and is associated with a biological need - hunger, sleep, sexual behavior, or even a biological &quot;need for activity.&quot;</li>
	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>second stimulus</strong>&nbsp;is neutral - that is to say, it has no current impact on behavior</li>
	<li>The first stimulus and second stimulus are repeatedly presented together at the same time (<strong>paired</strong>)</li>
	<li>After some period of time, the organism will begin to react to the second stimulus as if it were the first - this is called <em>conditioning!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This is process is now commonly known as <strong>Classical Conditioning</strong>, <strong>Pavlovian conditioning</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Respondent Conditioning</strong>. While the names are very different, they do commonly refer to this pairing process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="font-style:italic"><strong>Types of Conditioning</strong></h2>

<p>There are many types of conditioning, which can have an impact on how the organism learns. The effect on learning can be to make it more efficient or less efficient. This is done by manipulating the temporal arrangement (<em>order in time</em>)&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>Conditioned Stimulus</em>&nbsp;(abbreviated as CS) and the&nbsp;<em>Unconditioned Stimulus</em>&nbsp;(abbreviated as US).&nbsp;Here are some examples (keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Forward Conditioning:</strong>&nbsp;learning is fastest in forward conditioning. During forward conditioning, the onset of the CS precedes the onset of the US.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Simultaneous Conditioning:</strong>&nbsp;during simultaneous conditioning, the CS and US are presented and terminated at the same time</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Backwards Conditioning:</strong>&nbsp;backward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US, and usually has the opposite effect as forward conditioning: that is to say, the organism learns that the CS signals the end of the US.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Extinction:&nbsp;</strong>the CS is repeatedly presented but the US does not follow. This, of course, must be done after the CS is already conditioned</li>
</ul>

INSERT INTO `quiz_question` VALUES (6,'<p>Which of the following is a type of&nbsp;<strong><u>CONTINUOUS</u></strong>&nbsp;data collection method?</p>','2017-05-31 04:23:50','<h2 style="font-style:italic">Continuous Measurement&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Continuous measurement data collection systems&nbsp;<u>capture every possible occurence</u>&nbsp;of a behavior of interest. Some of the benefits of continuous measurement systems is they capture every instance of the behavior, therefore, are much more accurate than discontinuous data collection systems. However, as you can imagine, it can be very burdensome to implement a continuous data collection system (such as a frequency count) for a behavior that is very high-rate or near constant. Similarly, if you are a teacher working in a classroom of twenty or thirty kids, constantly measuring the behavior of just one student while tending to the needs of all the others would be a real challenge!</p>

<p>So while continuous measurement systems are excellent at providing a complete record of the behavior of interest, they are limited by the resources available - it might just not be possible or practical to require data collectors to count each incident of behavior in some way.</p>

<h3><strong>Continuous measurement systems come in a variety of different common types, as follows:</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Frequency</strong>&nbsp;- counting each individual event</li>
	<li><strong>Inter-Response Time</strong>&nbsp;- counting the time from the&nbsp;<u>offset</u>&nbsp;(end) of one response, to the&nbsp;<u>onset</u>&nbsp;(start) of the next response.</li>
	<li><strong>Duration</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;the number of seconds from the&nbsp;<u>onset</u>&nbsp;(start) of the&nbsp;response&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<u>offset</u>&nbsp;(end) of the response.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;</h2>

<h2 style="font-style:italic">Discontinuous Measurement&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Discontinuous measurement systems only capture a percentage of the behavior of interest. While they are, as a result of this, inherently less accurate than continuous measurement systems, they are much easier to implement as recording each instance of the behavior is not necessary. Instead, data collectors only need to record a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; value for blocks of time during an interval based off specific criteria, as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Whole-Interval Data Recording</strong>&nbsp;- recording the behavior&nbsp;<u>ONLY</u>&nbsp;if the behavior occurs for the entire interval (from the beginning until the end of the interval, without stopping!)</li>
	<li><strong>Partial-Interval Data Recording</strong>&nbsp;- recording the behavior if it happens at any point in the entire interval.</li>
	<li><strong>Momentary Time Sampling</strong>- recording the behavior if it happens ONLY at a specific moment at time, between the intervals. For example, if you were observing every 5 minutes, you&#39;d set a timer for 5 minutes and look up upon the timer&#39;s alarm and identify (yes or no) if the behavior is occurring in that instant and that instant only.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of each time of discontinuos data recording type. Whole-interval recording is great for behaviors you want to see increase for the entirety of an interval, such as, say, staying in your seat during math class. Partial-interval recording is useful when you want to see a behavior decrease or not exist at all during an interval, such as tantrums during homework time. Finally, Momentary Time Sampling is useful for recording the behavior of large groups of individuals (for whom it would be just too cumbersome to individually record), such as kids playing on a playground appropriately vs inappropriately (whatever your definition of &quot;appropriate&quot; is).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Discontinuos Sampling Measurement Example:</strong></p>

<p>Consider the following example to illistrate how different types of discontinuous measurement systems may report completely different (and possibly misleading!) results from the exact same data set:</p>

<p>Perhaps you are recording data on the following behavior-of-interest, &quot;screaming during circle time.&quot; The student engages in screaming at the following points in time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>from 9:03 - 9:06, for about 3 minutes and 33 seconds</li>
	<li>from, 9:10 - 9:15, for 5 minutes and 15 seconds</li>
	<li>from 9:21 - 9:22, for about 30 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>The total duration of screaming (in terms of&nbsp;<strong>duration</strong>, which is, remember, a&nbsp;<u>continuous</u>&nbsp;measurement) is <strong>9 minutes, 18 seconds&nbsp;</strong>out of a period of 25 minutes (about 36% occurence of the total duration for circle time)</p>

<p>We would record a &quot;0&quot; below if the behavior met criteria, and an &quot;X&quot; if it meets criteria. As discontinous measurement records, they would appear as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Our Results</strong></u>:</p>

<p>Remember that the actual duration for this hypothetical behavior was 9 minutes and 18 seconds, or about 36% occurrence of the total duration of our imaginary circle time.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Whole-Interval Data Recording</strong>&nbsp;<u>underestimated</u>&nbsp;occurrence at 20% (1 / 5 intervals as &quot;X&quot; or &quot;yes&quot;)</li>

<p>Overall, practitioners are using discontinuous methods more and more, as they are much easier to use and can, with caution and mindfulness, be effective at representing an intervention&#39;s impact on a behavior in a useful way. However, as you can see from the example above, incorrect use of discontinous sampling methods could mislead practitioners and misrepresent reality!</p>

<p>For a behavior to be measured using permanent product recordings, the behavior must leave something behind following it&#39;s occurrence. This is referred to as a&nbsp;<u>product</u>. This product must last long enough to be recorded by the observer, and be reasonably representative of each occurrence of the behavior. It is up to the analyst to decide, based off the outcome, whether the correlation between product and occurrence of behavior is high enough.

Deceptive behavior hinders the reliability of permanent products as a data collection tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Permanent products are advantageous for a few reasons. Chiefly, they do not require an observe to constantly monitor the person engaging in the behavior of interest. Secondly, verification and scoring of the product can be done at a later date by an observer who may require training to score a permanent product effectively (for instance, collecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaner-Bloser">Zaner-Bloser</a> data on handwriting legibility).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s compare rate to frequency and see if that helps!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine that we have a small child who comes to a clinic for behavioral therapy twice a week. Without telling you anything else, I simply present to you the following data:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Monday:</strong>&nbsp;150 episodes of aggression</li>
	<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong>&nbsp;200 episodes of aggression</li>
	<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong>&nbsp;200 episodes of aggression</li>
</ul>

<p>Just looking at that data, we&#39;d say Tuesday &amp; Wednesday weren&#39;t&nbsp;very good days. We&#39;d conclude that there was an increasing trend in the behavior (things are getting worse) just on those three data points!</p>

<p>However, let&#39;s expand our scenario a little bit. Let&#39;s say that our client&#39;s schedule is not the same on those three days, and it looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Monday:</strong>&nbsp;10:00am - 12:00pm</li>
	<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong>&nbsp;12:00pm - 5:00pm</li>
	<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong>&nbsp;10:00pm - 6:00pm</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now let&#39;s compare that data, one more time:</strong></p>

<p>From this example, we can see that rate can be pretty misleading!&nbsp;<strong>Changing the unit of measure changes our analysis of the situation!</strong>&nbsp;The behavior appears to be&nbsp;<em>increasing&nbsp;</em>when described as a <u>frequency</u> measure, but is definitely&nbsp;<em>decreasing</em>&nbsp;when described as a <u>rate</u> measure!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Moral of the story?</strong>&nbsp;Be very careful when selecting a data type - all things considered, it&#39;s usually best to use rate when continuously tracking the occurrence of discrete behaviors for the simple reason that it allows you to more effectively compare behavior at different points in time.</p>',2,1,3,4);

<p>Of the following, which are examples of discontinuous data collection?</p>','2018-04-25 03:03:55','<p>The following are common types of&nbsp;<strong>DISCONTINUOUS&nbsp;</strong>data collection:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>1. Momentary Time Sampling</strong> - recording data (YES or NO) regarding the occurrence of a behavior at a specific moment in time. This means that if the behavior was occurring for the entirety of the interval, but just happened to briefly stop at the point in time in which we observe the behavior, we might still mark &#39;no.&#39; This is one of the obvious drawbacks of this data collection scheme. One of the up-sides is that it&#39;s relatively resource unintensive - a single data collector could easily take data on many&nbsp;individuals simultaneously without becoming too overloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2. Partial Interval Recording -&nbsp;</strong>recording data (YES or NO) if the behavior occurs&nbsp;<u>for any part</u>&nbsp;of a given interval. For example, if the behavior occurs for 1 second or for the entire interval, you would still score it as a single &quot;yes&quot; for that interval. As a result, this type of recording tends to over-estimate behavior, which may be a good thing, depending on what you&#39;re trying to measure. For example, if you&#39;re teaching someone not to bite their teachers, even 1 second of biting could be pretty painful and disruptive. Therefore, you&#39;d be happy with overestimation as it would help guide treatment decisions in the right direction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>3. Whole Interval Recording -&nbsp;</strong>recording data (YES or NO) if the behavior occurs&nbsp;<u>for the ENTIRETY</u>&nbsp;of an observation interval. For example, if the behavior occurs for 59&nbsp;seconds out of a 60 second observation interval, you would not score that interval! That seems pretty arbitrary, but it has it&#39;s benefits - imagine a scenario where you are attempting to take data on many learners who are supposed to be working on independent work. These same learners must raise their hand if they&#39;d like to get up from their table work. You could easily task a single teacher with taking WIR data on 5 or even 10 kids, and if you&#39;re interested in seeing an increase in their in-seat, on-task behavior, this would be a conservative measure of those behaviors -- a graph with a score of 100% would truly represent mastery, as even a single second of out-of-seat behavior would cost them an entire interval&#39;s score!</p>',2,1,4,4);

It is important to be familiar with these terms&nbsp;before using an assessment, so that you understand the implications of the assessment you are working with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Developmental assessments</strong>&nbsp;are linked to the individual&rsquo;s chronological age (how old they actually are) versus how old they are in terms of the skills they have learned in contrast to the skills typically learned by that age. This is referred to as their &ldquo;developmental age.&rdquo; The goal for clinicians using a developmental assessment is to calculate the difference between the client&rsquo;s chronological age and their developmental age, attempting to &ldquo;close the gap&rdquo; as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Criterion-based</strong>&nbsp;assessments involve presenting skills with specific criteria (an objective performance measure) that need to be mastered before the skill is considered mastered. These skills are typically organized into long-term goals, short-term goals, and instructional goals (from broader to narrow focus) for the convenience of the professional using the assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum-based </strong>assessments are assessments organized in a progressive manner, with suggestions and guides for progressing from one skill to the next as part of a coordinated curriculum. They give you examples of what to teach and in what order, and may also include teaching materials (such as worksheets, manipulative, sight word decks, etc.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Social skills </strong>assessments directly target social behaviors and often require the presence of one or more (or even groups) of similarly skilled peers. This is one of the inherent limitations of a social skills program - if the client does not have access to an environment with similar peers from whom social behaviors can contact reinforcement, no social skills program will be effective. Social skills curricula typical emphasize skills such as verbal behavior, understanding body language, defining and interpreting emotions of yourself and others, and other similar behaviors that typically produce socially mediated reinforcers. This can also include some &ldquo;a-social&rdquo; skills, such as brushing your teeth or wearing deodorant, as these skills impact your relationships with others (being &ldquo;stinky&rdquo; might repel others).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Norm-referenced </strong>assessments calculate a quotient score, which can be compared against a standard of deviation to determine where the user performs compared to other persons using the assessment. For example, a score of 100 is &ldquo;average&rdquo; and reflective of typical performance on that assessment by typical members of the population the assessment is designed for (i.e., school kids in the first grade, or children at the age of 5). A score of 120 would be above average, and a score of 80 would be below average.</p>

<p>There are many types of&nbsp;<strong>preference assssments</strong>&nbsp;- here are the different types:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Multiple Stimulus&nbsp;<u>WITH</u>&nbsp;Replacement</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>multiple stimulus&nbsp;<u>with</u>&nbsp;replacement</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of typically 5 - 7 items at a time to determine which items are the most preferred and allow you to identify what is the &quot;most valuable&quot; item(s) from the array. Typically, one item will stand out from it&#39;s peers in the array - such as a special toy, like a blankie, or the iPad, etc. - that the individual will choose each and every time they are given the option to. Knowing what this stimulus is on a day-to-day basis can make these types of preference assessments incredibly valuable, especially for learners who have difficulty communicating their choice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best practice for behavior analysts to rotate the position of each item in the array&nbsp;to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

Since the items are not &quot;replaced&quot;, when the item is selected, it&#39;s gone for the remainder of that assessment, so typically the highest value items are selected first.

<p>Sometimes, the most useful information regarding preference can be gleaned from those who know the individual best. Asking caregivers informally, or by following a formal checklist, such as the&nbsp;<strong>RAISD,&nbsp;</strong>can be useful at identifying preferred stimuli.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Paired Stimulus Preference Assessments:</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>paired choice</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of 2 items at a time from a larger list (usually 7 - 12 items) to determine which items are the most preferred. Each item is presented in combination with every item on the list, so that the individual is given an opportunity to &quot;choose&quot; which item they like the most in a contest against every other item.</p>

<p>Often times, behavior analysts will ensure that the position (on the left, or on the right) of the various stimuli is evenly rotated to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>preference for a stimulus (like M&amp;Ms) does not necessarily imply that it will reinforce a <u>contingent</u> behavior! Reinforcer assessments are conducted when you need to demonstrate that a stimulus does have reinforcing value - preference assessments are typically done first to identify likely reinforcers.</p>

<p>Some big things to remember:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Things that you generally &quot;prefer&quot; to interact with in your free time (like, say, watching Netflix, Hulu, whatever) aren&#39;t the only reinforcers for behavior. For example, chapstick is a reinforcer (for the behavior of putting chapstick on my lips) but only when the EO (chapped lips) is present. Similarly, kleenex is a reinforcer (for the behavior of reaching for / buying / kleenex) but only when the EO (a runny nose) is present.</li>
	<li>A powerful reinforcer (coffee, ice cream, netflix - I&#39;m a simple man) may not be sufficient when the contingency is too demanding. For example, I will engage in high rates of &quot;button pushing&quot; to contact those items (uber eats; typing on a keyboard to find a show to watch; etc.). I will not engage in high rates of &quot;mowing the lawn of a football sized field&quot; to contact those reinforcers, however.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>E.G.</strong> You offer me a plate with $1.00, a skittle, an M&amp;M, and a smiley face sticker on it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Each time I would probably choose the $1.00. You might write down &quot;$1.00 is the most preferred item&quot; and then attempt to use it as a reinforcer for a variety of tasks. If one of the tasks was touching my nose, sure, I&#39;d be likely to find that $1.00 very reinforcing for that behavior. However, if you change the response requirement to &quot;building a brick house&quot; I am unlikely engage in very high rates of &quot;house-building&quot; behavior when the contingency is $1.00. My motivating operations will be changed by the response requirement, in this case! So keep that in mind when utilizing the results of your preferrence assessments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Similarly, states of <u>satiation</u> and <u>deprivation</u> may alter the value of stimuli. Tokens, such as a $1.00, can be exchange for a great many reinforcers, which makes it hard to satiate on them. However, if I was only offerred food items during a reinforcer assessment, and you determined my #1, #2, and #3 favorite foods accurately, and then tried to use those items as reinforcers after I ate a big meal at lunch... you&#39;d probably get a lot less behavior out of me. Motivation matters!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many types of <strong>preference assssments</strong> - here are the different types:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Trial Based Preference Assessments</h2>

<p>Sometimes, behavior analysts will conduct formal preference assessments using the discrete-trial methodology: presenting a formal antecedent, expecting a response - in this case, a selection, and consequating that response with access to the selected stimulus. What follows are preference assessments in the &quot;trial-based&quot; format:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Multiple Stimulus <u>WITH</u>&nbsp;Replacement</strong></h3>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>multiple stimulus&nbsp;<u>with</u>&nbsp;replacement</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of typically 5 - 7 items at a time to determine which items are the most preferred and allow you to identify what is the &quot;most valuable&quot; item(s) from the array. Typically, one item will stand out from it&#39;s peers in the array - such as a special toy, like a blankie, or the iPad, etc. - that the individual will choose each and every time they are given the option to. Knowing what this stimulus is on a day-to-day basis can make these types of preference assessments incredibly valuable, especially for learners who have difficulty communicating their choice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best practice for behavior analysts to rotate the position of each item in the array&nbsp;to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Multiple Stimulus <u>WITHOUT</u> Replacement (MSWO):</strong></h3>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Asking the Individual:</h2>

<h3><strong>Caregiver Report:</strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes, the most useful information regarding preference can be gleaned from those who know the individual best. Asking caregivers informally, or by following a formal checklist, such as the <strong>RAISD, </strong>can be useful at identifying preferred stimuli.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Pre-Trial / Post-Trial Choice:</strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes, an individual&#39;s preferences change rapidly, or may change as a result of performing a task. For example, my preference for water <em>before exercise</em> might be low, but following exercise, might be very high. Because of this variability, some behavior analysts will ask before or after the demand so that the individual can select the item in that instant, based off their motivation in that moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Paired Stimulus Preference Assessments:</strong></h3>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>paired choice</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of 2 items at a time from a larger list (usually 7 - 12 items) to determine which items are the most preferred. Each item is presented in combination with every item on the list, so that the individual is given an opportunity to &quot;choose&quot; which item they like the most in a contest against every other item.</p>

<p>Often times, behavior analysts will ensure that the position (on the left, or on the right) of the various stimuli is evenly rotated to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Free Operant Preference Assessments:</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>free operant</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment allows learners freedom to roam an area, such as a play room, and interact with any items in the room they find motivating. The&nbsp;<strong>duration of engagement&nbsp;</strong>is recorded for each item, allowing analysts to compare the amount of time the individual spent with each item, and therefore determine if one item was more &quot;valuable&quot; than another simply by comparing the quantity of time the individual allocated to interacting with one item(s) over other(s).</p>

<p>There are two basic &quot;types&quot; of free operant arrangements:</p>

<h3><strong>Contrived:</strong></h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Typically, during a contrived free-operant assessment, these rooms are either &quot;seeded&quot; with likely high-preference items based off care-giver / parent / guardian report, which increases the likelihood of the assessment being successful at generating a hierarchy (or ranking) of preferred items.</p>

<h3><strong>Naturalistic:</strong></h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">In this arrangement, the individual is observed where they typically spend most of their free or &quot;leisure&quot; time to identify how they allocate their responding.</p>

<h2><strong>How do MOs work?</strong></h2>

<p>From a behaviorist&#39;s point of view, we must describe all stimuli in terms of the objective outcomes in terms of behavior change - this helps us avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(psychology)">mentalistic</a> descriptions which are outside the purvue of behavioral science.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motivating operations&nbsp;<strong>(MOs)</strong>&nbsp;are linked to stimuli, and impact&nbsp;<u>the organism</u>&nbsp;in two ways:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>1.&nbsp; Value-altering effect</strong>: they modify (increase or decrease) the efficacy of a stimulus as a punisher or reinforcer</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2.&nbsp; Behavior-altering effect:</strong>&nbsp;they increase the frequency (increase or decrease) of a behavior that has been punished or reinforced by that stimulus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the sight of an empty gas guage while driving down the highway will&nbsp;<u>increase</u>&nbsp;the effectiveness of behaviors that produce gasoline as reinforcers (value-altering: <u>increase</u>), and increase the momentary frequency of behaviors that produce gasoline (behavior-altering: <u>increase</u>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other behaviors that will fill up your gas tank will also experience the same effect, proportional to their availability (as signaled by SDs) and their individual learning histories (of reinforcement, punishment). For example, maybe calling a roadside assistance service (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Automobile_Association">AAA</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiking">pulling over to the side of the road and sticking your thumb up</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conversely, the sight of a full gas guage while driving down the road will&nbsp;<u>decrease</u>&nbsp;the effectiveness of behaviors that produce gasoline as reinforcers (value-altering:&nbsp;<u>decrease</u>), and&nbsp;<u>decrease</u>&nbsp;the momentary frequency of behaviors that might produce gasoline (behavior-altering:&nbsp;<u>decrease</u>).</p>

<p>The following are common types of&nbsp;<strong>DISCONTINUOUS&nbsp;</strong>data collection:</p>

This means that if the behavior was occurring for the entirety of the interval, but just happened to briefly stop at the point in time in which we observe the behavior, we might still mark &#39;no.&#39; This is one of the obvious drawbacks of this data collection scheme. One of the up-sides is that it&#39;s relatively resource unintensive - a single data collector could easily take data on many&nbsp;individuals simultaneously without becoming too overloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2. Partial Interval Recording -&nbsp;</strong>recording data (YES or NO) if the behavior occurs&nbsp;<u>for any part</u>&nbsp;of a given interval.

As a result, this type of recording tends to over-estimate behavior, which may be a good thing, depending on what you&#39;re trying to measure. For example, if you&#39;re teaching someone not to bite their teachers, even 1 second of biting could be pretty painful and disruptive. Therefore, you&#39;d be happy with overestimation as it would help guide treatment decisions in the right direction.</p>

	<li><strong>Attention</strong>&nbsp;- an adult pre-occupeis themselves with some activity and &quot;ignores&quot; the child, and attention is provided only contingent upon the behavior of interest occurring</li>
	<li><strong>Escape&nbsp;</strong>- demands are placed (typically academic,&nbsp;but they can be any type of demands) and escape is provided contingent upon the behavior of interest occurring</li>
	<li><strong>Control -&nbsp;</strong>the client receives attention and free access to high-value reinforcers.&nbsp;No additional consequence for the behavior of interest.</li>
	<li><strong>Alone -&nbsp;</strong>the client is left &quot;alone&quot; (i.e., in a room which has a few low to medium preference activities for them to engage in) and an adult pre-occupies themself with some other activity. No additional consequence for the behavior of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many crucial ethical concerns to take into account when implementing a functional analysis, and informed consent of parents or caregivers is required. Sometimes, behaviors are too dangerous to conduct a functional analysis safely on - for instance, if a client engages in dangerous eye-gouging, exposing this behavior (eye-gouging) to reinforcement even briefly&nbsp;could be tremendously risky!</p>',1,1,10,1);

<p>Some families may change their child&#39;s medication on a day-to-day basis (even without approval from a child&#39;s pediatrician) and this can severely alter their behavior, as you would imagine.

<p>RBTs may know their clients better than their supervisors, and in some respects, even their parents - some clients may work with a single therapist 20 - 30 hours a week, every week. That&#39;s a lot of 1-on-1 time!</p>

<p>To ensure quality service delivery, the RBT is supervised for 5% of all hours worked in a service delivery period, and must pass a competency exam as well as a supervised observational period.</p>

<p>Holy crap! That&#39;s a big difference in meaning. The <u>COUNT</u> data (table A) shows an <strong>increasing</strong> trend as the week goes on, and would be a cause for alarm if we were treating a problem behavior (or celebration if we were tracking some new, great skill).</p>

<p>However, when the COUNT is converted into FREQUENCY / RATE we see a different, more accurate story. The client&#39;s week gets longer and longer as the week goes on, resulting in a pretty substantial decrease as time goes on (a little more than 50% decrease). Whether that&#39;s good or bad, of course, depends on whatever the behavior is, but you can see how if your client has different sessions, comparing COUNT to RATE can be very misleading and influence your judgements improperly.</p>

<p>There are many types of <strong>preference assssments</strong> - here are the different types:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Multiple Stimulus <u>WITH</u>&nbsp;Replacement</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>multiple stimulus&nbsp;<u>with</u>&nbsp;replacement</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of typically 5 - 7 items at a time to determine which items are the most preferred and allow you to identify what is the &quot;most valuable&quot; item(s) from the array. Typically, one item will stand out from it&#39;s peers in the array - such as a special toy, like a blankie, or the iPad, etc. - that the individual will choose each and every time they are given the option to. Knowing what this stimulus is on a day-to-day basis can make these types of preference assessments incredibly valuable, especially for learners who have difficulty communicating their choice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best practice for behavior analysts to rotate the position of each item in the array&nbsp;to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Multiple Stimulus <u>WITHOUT</u> Replacement (MSWO):</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO - yes, I know, the acronym MSWO is missing the &quot;r&quot; so that&#39;s confusing!)</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of typically 5 - 7 items at a time to determine which items are the most preferred and create a hierarchy of those items. Since the items are not &quot;replaced&quot;, when the item is selected, it&#39;s gone for the remainder of that assessment, so typically the highest value items are selected first. This assessment is often repeated several times to determine the average &quot;rank&quot; of each item in the array.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Paired Stimulus Preference Assessments:</strong></h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>paired choice</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment involves the presentation of 2 items at a time from a larger list (usually 7 - 12 items) to determine which items are the most preferred. Each item is presented in combination with every item on the list, so that the individual is given an opportunity to &quot;choose&quot; which item they like the most in a contest against every other item.</p>

<p>Often times, behavior analysts will ensure that the position (on the left, or on the right) of the various stimuli is evenly rotated to ensure that the individual is not just &quot;choosing the item on the right side&quot; (or exhibiting some other kind of position bias).</p>

<p>Food items are typically not intermixed with tangible items during preference assessments, as research suggests that some individuals may exhibit preference for food items over tangible items and skew results of such intermixed assessments.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>free operant</strong>&nbsp;preference assessment allows learners freedom to roam an area, such as a play room, and interact with any items in the room they find motivating. The&nbsp;<strong>duration of engagement&nbsp;</strong>is recorded for each item, allowing analysts to compare the amount of time the individual spent with each item, and therefore determine if one item was more &quot;valuable&quot; than another simply by comparing the quantity of time the individual allocated to interacting with one item(s) over other(s).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Pre-Trial / Post-Trial Choice:</strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes, an individual&#39;s preferences change rapidly, or may change as a result of performing a task. For example, my preference for water <em>before exercise</em> might be low, but following exercise, might be very high. Because of this variability, some behavior analysts will ask before or after the demand so that the individual can select the item in that instant, based off their motivation in that moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

It is important to be familiar with these terms&nbsp;before using an assessment, so that you understand the implications of the assessment you are working with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Developmental assessments</strong> assess skills based both on the individual&rsquo;s chronological age (how old they actually are) versus how old they are in terms of the skills they have learned in contrast to the skills typically learned by that age. This is referred to as their &ldquo;developmental age.&rdquo; The goal for clinicians using a developmental assessment is to calculate the difference between the client&rsquo;s chronological age and their developmental age, attempting to &ldquo;close the gap&rdquo; as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Criterion-based</strong>&nbsp;assessments involve presenting skills with specific criteria (an objective performance measure) that need to be mastered before the skill is considered mastered. These skills are typically organized into long-term goals, short-term goals, and instructional goals (from broader to narrow focus) for the convenience of the professional using the assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum-based </strong>assessments are assessments organized in a progressive manner, with suggestions and guides for progressing from one skill to the next as part of a coordinated curriculum. They give you examples of what to teach and in what order, and may also include teaching materials (such as worksheets, manipulative, sight word decks, etc.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Social skills </strong>assessments directly target social behaviors and often require the presence of one or more (or even groups) of similarly skilled peers. This is one of the inherent limitations of a social skills program - if the client does not have access to an environment with similar peers from whom social behaviors can contact reinforcement, no social skills program will be effective. Social skills curricula typical emphasize skills such as verbal behavior, understanding body language, defining and interpreting emotions of yourself and others, and other similar behaviors that typically produce socially mediated reinforcers. This can also include some &ldquo;a-social&rdquo; skills, such as brushing your teeth or wearing deodorant, as these skills impact your relationships with others (being &ldquo;stinky&rdquo; might repel others).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Norm-referenced </strong>assessments calculate a quotient score, which can be compared against a standard of deviation to determine where the user performs compared to other persons using the assessment. For example, a score of 100 is &ldquo;average&rdquo; and reflective of typical performance on that assessment by typical members of the population the assessment is designed for (i.e., school kids in the first grade, or children at the age of 5).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Developmental assessments</strong> assess skills based both on the individual&rsquo;s chronological age (how old they actually are) versus how old they are in terms of the skills they have learned in contrast to the skills typically learned by that age. This is referred to as their &ldquo;developmental age.&rdquo; The goal for clinicians using a developmental assessment is to calculate the difference between the client&rsquo;s chronological age and their developmental age, attempting to &ldquo;close the gap&rdquo; as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Criterion-based</strong>&nbsp;assessments involve presenting skills with specific criteria (an objective performance measure) that need to be mastered before the skill is considered mastered. These skills are typically organized into long-term goals, short-term goals, and instructional goals (from broader to narrow focus) for the convenience of the professional using the assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum-based </strong>assessments are assessments organized in a progressive manner, with suggestions and guides for progressing from one skill to the next as part of a coordinated curriculum. They give you examples of what to teach and in what order, and may also include teaching materials (such as worksheets, manipulative, sight word decks, etc.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Social skills </strong>assessments directly target social behaviors and often require the presence of one or more (or even groups) of similarly skilled peers. This is one of the inherent limitations of a social skills program - if the client does not have access to an environment with similar peers from whom social behaviors can contact reinforcement, no social skills program will be effective. Social skills curricula typical emphasize skills such as verbal behavior, understanding body language, defining and interpreting emotions of yourself and others, and other similar behaviors that typically produce socially mediated reinforcers. This can also include some &ldquo;a-social&rdquo; skills, such as brushing your teeth or wearing deodorant, as these skills impact your relationships with others (being &ldquo;stinky&rdquo; might repel others).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Norm-referenced </strong>assessments calculate a quotient score, which can be compared against a standard of deviation to determine where the user performs compared to other persons using the assessment. For example, a score of 100 is &ldquo;average&rdquo; and reflective of typical performance on that assessment by typical members of the population the assessment is designed for (i.e., school kids in the first grade, or children at the age of 5).

<p>In behavior analysis, function is everything. The <strong>function</strong> refers to the maintaining <u>reinforcers</u>. Definitionally speaking, a reinforcer is something that causes a behavior to increase over time when that same behavior reliably produces that reinforcer in a specific set of stimulus conditions (the <em>antecedent</em>).</p>

<p>This is just a fancy way of saying that behaviors that produce &quot;good things&quot; tend to increase or remain strong in an organism&#39;s repertoire of behavior, whereas behaviors that don&#39;t produce anything (or produce &quot;bad things&quot;) will extinguish - that is to say, <em>disappear</em> - form that organism&#39;s repertoire of behavior.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why is this important to treating a behavioral problem?</strong></h2>

<p>When you know what is reinforcing a behavior, you can manipulate the environment more precisely and effectively. If, for example, a behavior such as &quot;aggression&quot; has a function of producing adult attention, you could design a 2-component treatment package very easily for that child:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Place aggression on <u>extinction</u> (or have it produce low-quality <em>attention</em>)</li>
	<li>Reinforce an alternative behavior, such saying &quot;hey&quot; or &quot;excuse me&quot; or signing &quot;help&quot; (or something along those lines)</li>
</ol>

<p>This example serves to illustrate the importance of function because if the function where <em>anything else</em>, this treatment might not work or even have the opposite effect (make the behavior worse).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So what&#39;s the big deal?</h2>

<p>For example, let&#39;s suppose the function in the example treatment package above was not attention as we originally said it was - now, let&#39;s pretend the function is to obtain a favorite type of candy. If a BCBA and a team of RBTs is working with a client, blind to the true function of the behavior, ignoring the behavior will not likely trigger any functional effect. Indeed, teaching the client to say &quot;help&quot; is likely to make little progress as well, as the child&#39;s behavior is not maintained by a need for &quot;help&quot; or any form of adult attention - they&#39;re hungry, and want a snack! Without knowing the function, the problem behavior will simply persist and the team of RBTs / BCBAs will soon become very frustrated (not to mention the client will still remain hungry and aggressive).</p>',3,1,10,11);

<p>A <strong>task analysis</strong> is used by behavior analysts to break a complicated task down into a more easily accomplishable sequence of smaller, simpler steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Chaining:</strong></h3>

<p>This is typically referred to as a <u>behavior chains</u>: a specific sequence of responses that serve as individual members of a chain; each step serving as the reinforcer for the previous step and signaling the availability of reinforcement for completing the next response in the chain. The last step in the chain contacts the &quot;terminal reinforcer&quot; that maintains the whole chain. The terminal reinforcer for a behavior chain such as &quot;making a sandwich&quot; would be, of course, getting to eat the sandwich!</p>

<p><strong>It can be helpful to think of task analyses / behavior chains as &quot;recipes&quot; - they&#39;re sort of like &quot;behavioral recipes!&quot; that produce consequences in the environment instead of food (although, of course, sometimes the consequence of our behavior is food).</strong></p>

<p>There are three general methods for teaching a task analysis:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Total or Whole Task Teaching </strong>refers to the teaching all&nbsp;of the steps in a task analysis and providing reinforcement differential to independence on any given step(s) in the task analysis.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Forward Chaining</strong> refers to starting at the initial step of a task analysis and providing prompting / reinforcement until that step is mastered. All subsequent steps are typically &quot;teacher-completed,&quot; i.e., the teacher provides hand-over-hand assistance on all un-mastered steps. When the first step is mastered, the second step is introduced into teaching until all steps are mastered, from start --&gt; finish!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Backwards Chaining</strong> refers to starting at the very last step of a task analysis and providing prompting / reinforcement until that step is mastered, and then introducing the next-to-last step into teaching after that, and so on, until all steps are mastered. The teacher will also complete any steps that are not mastered / currently in teaching. This type of chaining is used frequently when there may be some benefit to having the learner contact the &quot;terminal step&quot; from the get-go: e.g., if your learner likes to run around outside, having them complete only the last step to tying their shoes helps establish a learning history that compliance and completion of the shoe-tying task leads to an awesome time outside on the playground.</p>

INSERT INTO `pages_pages` VALUES (1,'What is ABA?','<p>ABA is the science of how organisms learn. Like any science, the repeated testing of a hypothesis is used to discover objective truth about the universe around us.</p>

<p>Like other natural sciences, like physics and chemistry, ABA focuses on natural phenomenon. Physicists study the behavior of matter and forces, biologists study the process of life, and behaviorists study the way that complex life learns and adapts to it&#39;s surroundings. Amoeba do this, your pets do this, and you yourself are actively doing engaging in behavior right now. The behaviorist studies this process of learning and adapting.</p>

<p>ABA stands for <em><strong>A</strong></em>pplied <em><strong>B</strong></em>ehavior <em><strong>A</strong></em>nalysis. The <u>applied</u> part refers to taking the science of behavior and <u>applying</u> it directly to improving some human need. For example, an applied materials engineer studies better materials to make our smartphones with, which might make them less likely to break easily when we drop them. An applied behavior analyst studies technologies that affect behavior change, typically in people (but sometimes in animals), that improve the lives of people, families, societies, corporations, schools, and your pets.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all likely benefited - and also sufferred - from the science of behavior analysis. Organizations use behavior analysis to train their employees faster. Our schools utilize behavioral techniques like reinforcement, choral responding, and precision teaching to help kids learn more efficiently. My local pet store uses behavior analysis during weekly dog training classes, complete with snazzy looking graphs of doggie behavior. Google uses behavior analysis to track your online web traffic, which it then sells to advertisers who then try to market stuff to you based off your behavior. Like any science, some of this benefits us, some of it&#39;s neutral, and some of it outright harms us. Just like the study of physics has produced both the miracle of space flight and the horror of atomic warfare, behavior analysis has produced both hope and despair from the activities of it&#39;s practitioners.</p>

INSERT INTO `pages_pages` VALUES (2,'Behavioral Basics','<p>So, you want to learn a little bit about behavior analysis? That&rsquo;s awesome! But where the heck do you get started?&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a little overwhelming for folks who just want to &ldquo;jump in&rdquo; to the field - this is a profession&nbsp;that <em>loves</em>&nbsp;acronyms and field-specific jargon. And, let&rsquo;s be honest - there&rsquo;s plenty of redundant terminology, too.</p>

<p>From the outside, listening to two&nbsp;behavior analysts talk kinda sounds like people speaking a foreign language, or maybe&nbsp;like reading a teenagers text messages: you hear exchanges consisting of&nbsp;cryptic acronyms, baffling terminology...&nbsp;nothing makes sense anymore. You might have even taken a few classes in psychology in undergrad, so words like &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t scary to you, yet you hear people talking about echoics, mands, tacts... it just goes on and on. Someone says &ldquo;es-dee&rdquo;, &ldquo;em-oh&rdquo;, ABC, BCaBA, IRT, QWERTY... alright, I made that last one up. But the jist&nbsp;is there&rsquo;s a lot of terminology being thrown about and nobody&nbsp;is&nbsp;any damn sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: </strong>what follows is a rough draft, and I have not cited any sources. I plan to, but as a good scientist, you should always be <em>very skeptical</em>&nbsp;when some guy on the internet says a bunch of stuff without backing any of it up with some kind of supporting&nbsp;evidence.</p>

<div>Ok, so this is a science that is heavy on vocabulary. Let&rsquo;s get you up and running with a little introduction and short history of behaviorism (to provide context) before we&nbsp;jump into learning terminology and basic principles.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>For a long time, people have wanted to know why people do the things they do. In the last century, a great many scientists have dedicated their careers to identifying how and when people learn certain skills. Why are some people &ldquo;quick learners</div>

<div>&nbsp;while others are &ldquo;slow learners?&rdquo; What makes some folks extraordinary at certain skills - your Michael Jordans, Mozarts, etc. Are they just biologically better, or was their something unique to their training process and life experience? Was it some combination of the two? Scientists have asked and attempted to answer these questions since time immemorial. At the turn of the 20th century, a&nbsp;divide between members of psychological science&nbsp;began to form, with&nbsp;two basic ideas (among, well, others) coming forth.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Mentalists: </strong>folks like Freud, Piaget, Chomsky - these guys espoused notions centered around what we behavior analysts call&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<u>hypothetical constructs</u>&rdquo; - that is to say, they theorized that there exist machinery in the brain that develop and grow like your arms and bones do.&nbsp;These machinery&nbsp;enable us to&nbsp;produce all of the range of&nbsp;overt behaviors we see in humanity,&nbsp;like learning to talk, murdering each other, painting,&nbsp;building rocket ships, scuba diving,&nbsp;and creating governments. Neurology has begun to identify how some of these mechanisms might work, and has produced empirically validated models. However, this field is still much in its infancy and while exciting work is being done, we still have so much to learn. However, the future is bright! Perhaps, some day, we will be able to exactly pinpoint what parts of the brain do what.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>However, there is one type of drawback to this approach, which was of particular concern in the 1950s, prior to the advent of fMRIs and positron imagining technology and all that nice stuff. The mentalists offered explanatory <em>models </em>- however, these models were explanatory in the same sense that calling a bird a bird explains not a whole lot about what makes it able to fly, grow feathers when it loses them, etc.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the two common criticisms of mentalism:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Problem #1: </strong>the models often were predicated on circular logic - i.e. a person is autistic if they exhibit certain types of developmental delay. Okay, that&rsquo;s all very well - then why, you might ask, do they have these developmental delays? Why, because they have autism, of course! It becomes quite circular without a biological understanding of the disorder of interest. The term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; and any hypothetical construct models&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Problem #2:</strong>&nbsp;the models (especially in their early phases in the 1950s) produced limited predictive value. That is to say, they functioned more as a taxonomy of disorders than a list of problems that could be treated with specific procedures. This led to a rise - and perhaps over-emphasis - on what is purely and discretely measurable. If it happens in your head, some scientists decreed, it&rsquo;s of little value to the practitioner. Only the overt and observable were workable without lots of introspective analysis, and the results of that type of therapy have accrued dubious value. Furthermore, for individuals - such as those who have not yet acquired language, such as those with autism - introspective &ldquo;couch therapy&rdquo; can&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s hard to conduct a typical &ldquo;talking cure&rdquo; counseling session with an individual who can not communicate traditionally.</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">At this time, the best solution for folks with mental illness was institutionalization. Of course, in contemporary times, we have heard many horror stories, ranging from <strong>Nurse Ratchet</strong>&nbsp;in fiction to <strong>Sunland</strong>&nbsp;in reality. Bad things happen when people don&rsquo;t have the tools and skills needed, and for a long time, there simply was no way to practically approach treatment for most mental illness.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>So, these&nbsp;concerns above led some practitioners and scientists in the early and middle of the 19th century&nbsp;to seek another way to approach treatment for folks who wanted it or needed it. Psychiatrists and other practitioners were happy to refer their patients who did not or could not benefit from therapy and only seemed to respond to being heavily medicated.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Rise of the Behaviorists:</strong></div>

<div>So, we had some folks who wanted to <strong>prove </strong>there theories about observable behavior, and we had a group of professionals in the field of psychiatry that had patients that had proven to be intractable to every intervention available with the exception of powerful drugs or mechanical restraints.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The behaviors were not prepared, but still&nbsp;accepted these patients readily. Their approach was thus:&nbsp;instead of postulating on hypothetical models of often unobservable events in the brain, the behaviorists focus exclusively on what can be concretely measured and observed. What were their patients doing? What stimuli in their environment occurred before and after those behaviors? We&rsquo;re there reliable &ldquo;triggers&rdquo; for these behaviors? Could modifying the environment change the behavior of even the most difficult and intractable patient of the psychiatric ward?&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>These Behaviorists&nbsp;embodied in some respects&nbsp;the &ldquo;I have to see it to believe it&rdquo; philosophy and they also place a heavy emphasis on the <em>nurture </em>in the classic <em>nature vs. nurture</em>&nbsp;argument. They espoused that behavior was <strong>deterministic </strong>- it is lawful and ordered by a learning history (an organism&rsquo;s sum life experience) and that history can be changed to modify behavior.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s Classic <strong>Trading Spaces:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/tFcyEVnIoes">https://youtu.be/tFcyEVnIoes</a>&nbsp;- nature or nurture? This was the attitude of some early scientists, such as Watson &amp; Rainer of John Hopkins University who conducted the infamous <em>Little Albert </em>study.</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>So, how does this &ldquo;learning history&rdquo; work, exactly? How does &ldquo;nurture&rdquo; shape behavior, practically speaking?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The idea was simple: organisms engage in behavior of <strong>phylogenetic origin</strong>, that is to say, behavior that the organism is innately genetically programmed to do. This will be things&nbsp;like respiration, coughing after you inhale a puff of black pepper, and blinking.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>However, we all know that organisms do things that are not reflexive. This is the result of what we call colloquially &ldquo;learning.&rdquo;&nbsp;Organisms will,&nbsp;over time,&nbsp;encounter stimuli that correlate with forthcoming &ldquo;good&rdquo; or forthcoming &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; and this causes lasting change in their behavior over time. We call these behaviors &ldquo;<strong>operant</strong>&rdquo; - behaviors that are learned as the organism gains experience in it&rsquo;s environment.&nbsp;The base for all&nbsp;these behaviors still originates&nbsp;from those simple phylogenetic roots. Our&nbsp;reflex responses serve as the primordial building blocks that predispose us and eventually help construct the sophisticated <strong>operant&nbsp;</strong>behavior seen by&nbsp;astronauts, mass murderers, your ability to spell,&nbsp;and poets like Lord Byron. B.F.&nbsp;Skinner (we&rsquo;ll get to him next) was a scientist who coined this term (operant). He went even further, developing&nbsp;the <strong>operant contingency: </strong>the fancy, scientist way of describing&nbsp;a learned relationship. Pretty darn simple stuff,&nbsp;but powerful.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It&rsquo;s easy to take for granted that these ideas are &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;basic&rdquo; - just like the trappings of modern houses, such as flowing water, lights, and a hodgepodge of AI assistants that respond to your voice. Remember that, at the time that Skinner and other Behaviorists were first putting forth these ideas, well, folks were still espousing Freud&rsquo;s ideas about obsessive compulsive folks being stuck in a childhood phase predisposed to a fascination of their own anus. You can&rsquo;t tell me the operant contingency isn&rsquo;t an improvement over Freud&rsquo;s logic.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In in Skinnerks&nbsp;book, <em>The Behavior of Organisms, </em>he&nbsp;likened <strong>operant behavior</strong>&nbsp;to the same evolutionary processes (&ldquo;fitnesss&rdquo;)&nbsp;that shape&nbsp;the genetic code of every animal on earth.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This is profound, at least to me. The&nbsp;process of evolution is the very same fundamental force that drives changes in the operant behavior of organisms, and in the behavior of groups of organisms - for example, groups of humans arrange themselves in all kinds of ways,&nbsp;like the state of Florida, poetry societies, the civil rights movement, your local&nbsp;DMV, and that pesky&nbsp;homeowners association. All of these groups are, as a whole, sensitive to the evolutionary process that shapes both genes and behavior: the more adaptive a behavior (or gene) is for an organism, the more likely it will persist or even spread and grow, promulgating&nbsp;itself.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>They are all being shaped by consequences, just like a gene&rsquo;s ability to make an organism more &ldquo;fit&rdquo; gives that gene a greater chance of becoming more widespread if fitness is described as &ldquo;I can make more babies than my peers.&rdquo; Obviously, not all behaviors that we learn are related to sex and reproduction.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Instead of sex, the relative &ldquo;good&rdquo; that the behavior produces for&nbsp;the organism could be assessed in terms of survival value. Some behaviors produce food, money that can be used to buy food. Some behaviors produce abstract things, like &ldquo;power&rdquo; or &ldquo;respect&rdquo; that may give you security and the ability to care for your loved ones more effectively.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>What &ldquo;good&rdquo; is will vary from organism to organism based off what it needs to maintain itself biologically, and things that have gained value through the process of <strong>conditioning </strong>(more on that soon).&nbsp;It&rsquo;s wild how Darwinian this sounds, but that&rsquo;s no coincidence - everything is inexorably linked in nature.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Evolutionary theory&nbsp;is currently the most parsimonious explanation for not only how genetics works, but also&nbsp;why animals behave the way they do. Somewhere down the evolutionary tree of life, some organism experienced a mutation,&nbsp;and gained some primordial way to change its behavior by &ldquo;learning&rdquo;&nbsp;from consequence and not just rotely performing the instructions of it&rsquo;s genetic code.&nbsp;This critter probably did something simple - maybe just as simple as &ldquo;if some behavior produces nutrients, do that behavior more.&rdquo; Perhaps it was the opposite - &ldquo;if a behavior produces no food, do that less.&rdquo; Who knows.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This &ldquo;first learner&rdquo; was probably wildly successful because it could recover from mistakes without the delay of generations of&nbsp;&nbsp;reproducing - it&rsquo;s behavior could change within a single individual, in a single generation! The rest, as they say, is history - that &ldquo;first learner&rdquo; was wildly successful, procreated like nobody&rsquo;s business, and now that adaptive quality is shared by most organisms in Earth&rsquo;s tree of life.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The processes that govern behavior analysis are the same processes that govern evolutionary biology and genetics.&nbsp;Everything is linked - science is awesome like that!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Radical Behaviorists (that&rsquo;s us):</strong>&nbsp;alright, so you may have heard of a funny looking guy named B.F. Skinner. His first name, Burrhus, is a little unique so maybe that&rsquo;s why a lot of folks call him B.F. He had the (at the time) <u>radical</u>&nbsp;idea that behaviorists should also include what Skinner called &ldquo;private events&rdquo; - these are events that are perceptible only to the organism and do not produce any overtly measurable result to anybody&nbsp;observering the organism when the private event occurred.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3>So, what exactly are &ldquo;private events&rdquo;?</h3>

<div>So, Skinner&nbsp;considered&nbsp;things like &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; or feelings as&nbsp;private events - things that only the organism engaging in the behavior could perceive, thus, they are private. The voice inside your head - the one you are using to read this text, for example, is a type of private behavior. Some private behavior is becoming public with the advent of modern technology - for example, your heart beat was once fairly private, but nowadays your common smart watch will monitor your health statistics and post your peak beats per minute to social media, forever immortalizing your cardio awesomeness on the internet - hardly a &ldquo;private&rdquo; event anymore. Skinner predicted this - that technology would eventually make more and more private behavior &ldquo;public&rdquo; -&nbsp;which was profoundly prescient for a man working in the 1940s, long before the age of FitBits and Instagram.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This was a bit of a controversial notion at the time, and a lot of folks would argue about the validity of this concept for quite some time. In contemporary behavior analysis, radical behaviorism is currently the mainstream, and it serves as a&nbsp;bit of a happy compromise between the world of the mentalists and the world of the Behaviorists.</div>

<p><br />
Behavior Analysis is a wonderful field that can do a whole lot of good to a whole lot of people. However, our science can be a bit confusing. There are easy concepts, but also a whole lot of difficult things to learn, especially for parents, newcomers to the field, and people from other sciences.</p>

<p>This can make it difficult for people to understand, let alone appreciate, which is a real shame - if we understood our own psychology better, we might be able to do really great things in the world. Reduce hatred and bigotry, improve the lives of the impoverished, create safer cities - all of these things could be realized through the application of the scientific method to the study of human behavior.&nbsp; It&#39;s my mission to spread the knowledge of Applied Behavior Analysis to as many as possible, and to make access to that knowledge free.<br />

<p>What does that mean, and why is it significant? To me, it is one of the most beautiful, rational, and elegant solutions to explain why people do what they do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It all comes down to understanding how new behavior is created and changes over time. Any BCBA can (or should) describe the basics of <strong><u>operant psychology</u></strong> to you: behavior occurs in some environment, and it may produce a change in that environment. This change is called a <em>consequence</em>, which may affect future behavior in that organism. Generally, &quot;good&quot; consequences increase a behavior over time, and &quot;bad&quot; consequences decrease a behavior over time. An example: saying &quot;cookie&quot; might produce the consequence of getting you a cookie. This will strengthen the response of saying &quot;cookie,&quot; increasing that behavior over time. If the response of saying &quot;cookie&quot; only ever produces a cookie in certain environments - e.g., in a bakery, or grocery store - then the response of &quot;cookie&quot; will likely only occur in those environments over time, as it will &quot;die out&quot; (extinguish) in contexts where it produces no consequence. One might even imagine contexts were it might be punished - e.g., saying &quot;cookie&quot; at the home of a strict parent might engender a reprimand such as &quot;You know you don&#39;t get cookies before dinner! Stop bothering me!&quot;</p>

<p><em>Note: it is helpful to remember that behavior analysts say &quot;response&quot; and &quot;behavior&quot; to refer to the same thing.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>Evolution &amp; the Behaviorist Revolution</em></h3>

<p>Darwin ignited a scientific spark when he published his theory of evolution by natural selection, which has resulted in tremendous scientific advances. But how does this tie into behavior analysis?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is easy to draw comparisons from the concept of the <u>operant</u> (as described above) and the concept of <u>natural selection by consequences</u>. Not only is the terminology similar, but both processes possess striking similarity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mutation in <u>natural selection</u> is the driving force for evolutionary change. As genes are passed down from generation to generation, there are small changes that occur for a variety of causes - these are called <em><u>mutations</u></em>. A mutation may or may not cause a change in the organisms ability to survive, which directly impacts that genes ability to be spread (or not spread) in the gene pool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now consider behavior in the process of <u>operant </u><u>selection</u>: behaviors occur in an environment (&quot;context&quot;), and produce a change in that environment. No two occurrences of behavior are identical for a variety of factors: muscle fatigue, caffeination, disease, and any other number of contributions may contribute to differing form of behavior. Sometimes, this change may work out for the organism by producing better results, sometimes it may not. This <u><em>behavioral variability</em></u> is very similar to the <em><u>mutation</u></em> in natural selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine an example: a Baby babbling may produce a vocalization that sounds like &quot;bah.&quot; This may produce a change in the environment - the mother immediately attempts to provide a &quot;bottle&quot; due to the approximate similarity between &quot;bah&quot; and the word the mother knows: &quot;bottle.&quot; The baby&#39;s response &quot;bah&quot; is strengthened in situations where the &quot;bottle&quot; is desirable (i.e., the baby is hungry) and weakened in circumstances where the bottle is not desirable (i.e., the baby&#39;s diaper is soiled and uncomfortable, and the baby is full / not hungry). Over time, the baby may vocalize slightly different responses - &quot;bah&quot; may become &quot;bahbah&quot; by random chance. You might be able to imagine, from here, how the baby&#39;s initial babble may, over time, become &quot;bottle,&quot; through this process slight changes in response coupled with increasing enthusiasm of the mother as her child learns a word for &quot;bottle.&quot;</p>

<p>This variability in behavior is very similar to the <u>mutation</u> in natural selection, in both form and function. In fact, B.F. Skinner wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Contingencies of reinforcement also resemble contingencies of survival in the production of novelty . . . In both natural selection and operant conditioning the appearance of &ldquo;mutations&rdquo; is crucial.&rdquo; (pp. 246-247)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comparison between <u>mutation</u> and <u>variability in behavior</u> is important, as it united the philosophy behind the driving force for behavioral change and the driving force for biological change in organisms - evolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A quote from Wilson, Hayes, and Biglan&#39;s new book further describes this similarity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...What makes a theory of behavior evolutionary is not just that it is based in biology or on genetic selection, but rather that it relies on the integration of three interacting principles of change: variation, selection, and retention (transmission). &quot;</p>

<p>Biology and behavior are not different phenomena, but united, and driven by the same fundamental force. What shapes our ability to learn to read books, build automobiles, and study the cosmos is the same underlying force that drives biological change.</p>

INSERT INTO `blog_post` VALUES (4,'Stimulus Overselectivity','<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Many Board-Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), &nbsp;assistant analysts (BCaBA), and registered behavior techs (RBTs) serve those diagnosed with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum">Autism Spectrum Disorders</a></strong> (ASD), a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by deficits in language and social skills as well as repetitive or restrictive behavior patterns.&nbsp;In addition to these characteristics, some individuals with ASD may also display an abnormality in their attending commonly&nbsp;referred to in behavioral literature&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong><u>stimulus overselectivity</u></strong>&nbsp;or overselective stimulus control. It wouldn&#39;t be ABA if we didn&#39;t have at least two terms floating around to refer to the same thing.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>What is Stimulus Overselectivity?</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">The term&nbsp;<strong>stimulus overselectivity</strong>&nbsp;comes to us via&nbsp;Lovaas and Schreibman&nbsp;(<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5149581">Lovaas &amp; Schreibman, 1971</a></strong>) to describe a type of &quot;over-generalizing&quot; responding to stimuli that should not evoke that response. In these cases, responding is under the&nbsp;<u>anctedent control</u>&nbsp;of&nbsp;only one or a reduced number of stimuli&nbsp;instead of all relevant stimuli&nbsp;components that would, under better conditions, control the behavior. To help understand this, imagine your own behavior at a stop light: with correct training, you have learned that &quot;green&quot; means go, &quot;red&quot; means stop, and &quot;yellow&quot; means slow down and prepare to stop. If you exhibited stimulus overselective responding, you might &quot;stop&quot; at the presence of any illuminate light, and not discriminate between&nbsp;<em>which color is illuminated</em>. Your behavior is under the control of only one of the relevant stimuli - that a traffic light is present - and not all relevant stimuli: that a traffic light is present AND which light is currently illuminated (red, yellow, or green).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Let&#39;s look at another example:&nbsp;you may teach a student to identify a picture of a clock, and then observe that this student begin identifying pictures of beach-balls and dinner plates as &quot;clocks&quot;, perhaps because they share stimulus features, such as &quot;roundness&quot; or visual similarity to a circle. Additionally, you may teach a student to identify&nbsp;<em>forks</em>&nbsp;as silverware, and then observe this student referring to any utensil used for eating as a &quot;fork.&quot; That student&#39;s behavior is under the antecedent control of only ONE of the relevant stimulus features: the &quot;roundness&quot; and not under the other pertinent stimuli that might make a difference in your perception of beach balls, dinner plates, and clocks. A&nbsp;<em>subset of relevant stimuli</em>&nbsp;has control over your students behavior!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Typically developing children will display some of these characteristics and readily acquire the ability to make the discrimination between beach balls, dinner plates, and clocks with a few exposures to the stimuli. This type of discrimination is not limited to visual stimuli - consider also that a discrimination is being made in a scenario where a student is holding a microwaveable dinner and a parent vocalizes. In this case, the stimuli is&nbsp;<em>audible</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>auditory</em>&nbsp;- the learner must hear what their parent says, and respond accordingly: for instance, maybe Dad says &quot;go put it in the fridge&quot; or &quot;go put it in the microwave&quot; - the behavior evoked (either putting it in the fridge, or putting it in the microwave) depends on the learners ability to parse at least two environmental stimuli: the presence of the item to put away (the microwaveable meal) and the auditory stimulus in the form of the parent&#39;s command. If you think about your own life, you&#39;ll quickly realize that you&#39;re making discriminations&nbsp;<u>constantly</u>&nbsp;- if you had a deficit in making these types of simple discriminations, your day-to-day life and ability to acquire new learned behaviors would be dramatically effected. Over the next 5 minutes, observe your own behavior as you browse the web and identify the discriminations you make and how those control your behavior. When you open up your phone, you select an app from a wide array of app icons on the screen. If you find my writing very boring, you may want to&nbsp;close your browser window by&nbsp;selecting the &quot;x&quot; (and not the resize or minimize icons). After just a few minutes you&#39;ll realize the majority of your behavior requires a discrimination of some sort.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Conditional vs Simple Discriminations</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">The most basic type of discrimination you can make is sometimes referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>simple discrimination.&nbsp;</strong>In this type of task, there are three core elements: an antecedent, a response, and a consequence&nbsp;to that response. You may have heard this called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning"><strong>operant contingency</strong></a>, an &quot;S-R-S&quot; contingency, or even more informally as the&nbsp;<em>ABC&#39;s of Behavior</em>. Simple discriminations can come in two flavors: successive and simultaneous, which refer to how the antecedent stimuli are arranged. The &quot;correct&quot; behavior contacts reinforcement, whereas the incorrect behavior does not contact reinforcement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">​​In a <strong>conditional discrimination task</strong>,&nbsp;that same simple discrimination (antecedent-response-consequence) contingency exists with the addition of a <u>second-order discriminative stimulus</u>. A first-order discriminative stimulus serves as the primary cue to engage in a behavior, while a second-order discriminative stimulus further restricts this behavior to a more narrow set of conditions. Responses in the presence of both first and second-order discriminative stimuli (S<sup>D</sup>s) are reinforced whereas responses in the absence of first or second-order&nbsp;stimuli are not reinforced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Conditional discriminations are a common component in many types of tasks that a learner might encounter at a behavioral clinic. (<strong><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108835760101600203">Green, 2001</a></strong>).&nbsp;Behavior analysts often target conditional discriminations in their treatment plans, and many common behavioral assessments, such as the VB-MAPP&nbsp;and the ABLLS-R, provide specific developmental milestones for a learner&#39;s conditional discrimination making skills.&nbsp;Throughout any given day, most neurotypical individuals could, conceivably, make&nbsp;thousands of conditional discriminations, from identifying the correct letters to press to spell words using a keyboard, to selecting the soft drink you want from the vending machine outside your apartment,&nbsp;to identifying what things you should and should not say to your significant other while they&#39;re rambling on about their favorite TV show. As success at making conditional discriminations is foundational to successful performance in many other skill areas, it&#39;s no wonder why this is such a frequent target by BCBAs and educators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">A simple discrimination task involves three core elements: an antecedent, a response, and a consequence to that response. You may have heard this called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning"><strong>operant contingency</strong></a>, or even the <em>ABC&#39;s of Behavior</em>. In a conditional discrimination, that same simple discrimination (antecedent-response-consequence) contingency exists with the addition of a <u>second-order discriminative stimulus</u>. A first-order discriminative stimulus serves as the primary cue to engage in a behavior, while a second-order discriminative stimulus further restricts this behavior to a more narrow set of conditions. Responses in the presence of both first and second-order discriminative stimuli (S<sup>D</sup>s) are reinforced whereas responses in the absence of first or second-order&nbsp;stimuli are not reinforced. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">There exists a classic example of a conditional discrimination in animal behavior: a pigeon may learn to peck a button to receive food items as a reinforcer. However, food will only be dispensed in the presence of a green light. Over time and under typical conditions, the pigeons&#39; behavior will come into control of both the presence of the button and the illumination of the green light. Should either not be present, the pigeon will not attempt to peck to obtain food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">A more familiar conditional discrimination that (if you&#39;re like me, anyway) proves challenging even among neurotypical adults is remembering the names of other adults. In a large office setting, you might have to contend with making dozens of conditional discriminations in the morning. When you see&nbsp;a co-worker, you may have to quickly recall their name for any number of reasons. Correct recall of a person&#39;s name produces social reinforcement; incorrect recall does not (and, in fact, may contact social punishment).&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Incidence of Stimulus Overselectivity</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">The incidence rate of stimulus overselectivity has been described as very high in the population of those diagnosed with ASD.&nbsp;If you are someone who has worked in the field of <strong><a href="https://bacb.com/about-behavior-analysis/">Applied Behavior Analysis</a></strong> (ABA), chances are you&#39;ve at some time encountered an individual who has exhibited stimulus overselectivity. Since the original formalization of the term by&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5149581">Lovaas &amp; Schreibman</a></strong>&nbsp;in 1971, many analysts have reported very high incidence rates in a variety of research published in the <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22J+Appl+Behav+Anal.%22%5Bjour%5D">Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</a></strong>. It should be noted that, in 1971, the majority of individuals diagnosed with autism were on the more&nbsp;<em>severe</em>&nbsp;end of the spectrum as it is understood today. In 2013, the DSM-V redefined ASD to encompass the previous diagnoses of Asperger&nbsp;Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. As the criteria for diagnosis broadened and our understanding of autism has refined, many individuals now meet the criteria for ASD and it is possible that the original prevalence rates suggested by early literature are out of date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">In 2015, Dr. Sarah Rieth (BCBA-D)&nbsp;set out to update our understanding of how common stimulus overselectivity really is with an updated examination of prevalence in young children with ASD (<strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaba.165/full">Rieth SR, Stahmer AC, Suhrheinrich J, Schreibman L., 2015</a></strong>).&nbsp;Dr. Rieth and her&nbsp;team identified 19% of children (sample n = 42) as displaying signs of stimulus overselectivity after direct testing in a match-to-sample format training exercise. 19% is significantly lower than what was previously suspected (numbers vary from paper to paper, and this author drew no consensus other than it was &#39;higher than 19%&#39;). While 19% is lower, this is&nbsp;still nearly a 1 in 5 incidence rate!&nbsp;If 20% or more learners display difficulty acquiring conditional discriminations due to stimulus overselectivity, that is more than common enough to warrant serious demand for a behavioral technology to efficiently address this issue.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Reducing Stimulus Overselectivity: Some Available Technologies</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">In the field of behavior analysis, the term&nbsp;<strong>technology</strong>&nbsp;has a different connotation than that encountered in common parlance. In this setting, technology is used to describe an intervention or procedure (and not iPhones or fancy TVs). You, the reader, may be&nbsp;interested in identifying technologies available to us as applied practitioners who have clients with difficulties learning to make conditional discriminations due to stimulus overselectivity. As follows is a very brief review of some (and not all!) of the literature available in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. As always, read the articles yourself for more information and to verify that my interpretation of the researcher&#39;s findings is true and correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Extra-Stimulus Prompts</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Extra-stimulus prompting is an additional prompt presented simultaneously to the stimuli being trained. For example, pointing to a picture of the word &quot;cat&quot; in an array of three target words, such as &quot;cup&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, and &quot;car&quot; would be a common strategy to teach an individual with autism to identify the correct stimuli from an array of similar items (in this case, sight words&nbsp;begininning with the letter c). The idea is that by pointing to the correct item, the learner may be able to naturally identify the relevant differences in the stimuli by seeing the &quot;correct&quot; item in comparison to the &quot;incorrect&quot; stimuli. This supposes a lot, and the early literature generally found this approach ineffective&nbsp;(<strong><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00917605">Koegel and Rincover, 1976</a></strong>; <strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1901/jaba.1975.8-91/full">Schreibman, 1975</a></strong>) - to be fair, many participants are identified as &quot;stimulus overselective&quot; only after extensive training with extra-stimulus prompts has been conducted to not effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Differential Observing Responses</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">A <u>Differential Observing Response</u>&nbsp;(DOR) usually involves the learner engaging in some sort of requirement to observe a part or all of the stimuli before they can respond. An example could&nbsp;include asking a participate to name an item out loud before selecting in from an array (<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1146860">Constantine and Sidman, 1975</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14768668">Gutowski and&nbsp;Stromer, 2003</a></strong>), or -&nbsp;when participates are unable to name stimuli - using a compound matching or sorting task such as that described by <strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaba.290/full">Farber, Dube, Dickson in&nbsp;2016</a></strong>. In this study,&nbsp;a correct &quot;sample&quot; is presented and the learner must find the match in an array of slightly different stimuli. For example, a sample might include the word &quot;AT&quot; and the learner would be tasked with identifying an identical match from an array of three words: &quot;AT&quot;, &quot;AG&quot;, &quot;AF&quot;.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Within-Stimulus Modifications</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Another approach involves exaggerating the relevent differences between stimuli&nbsp;to increase the likelihood of a learner attending. For example, a learner displaying difficulty with the sight words &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, and &quot;mat&quot; may benefit from having the first letter highlighted or increased in size to make it more salient. As the student makes progress, the letters can be faded to normal systematically as the learner demonstrates mastery at each progressive step. There is evidence to suggest that within-stimulus prompts are more effective than extra-stimulus prompts (Schreibman, 1975) as the learner is actively observing a difference between the stimuli when within-stimulus prompting is used as opposed to responding to an external cue - such as a therapist&#39;s pointing gesture -&nbsp;when extra-stimulus prompts are used.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Schedule of Reinforcement Modifications</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Thinning a schedule of reinforcement may also be effective at reducing stimulus overselectivity by reducing or eliminating the reinforcement the learner may contact for &quot;guesswork.&quot; One simple modification would be to use a thin variable ratio schedule so that the learner continues to respond&nbsp;(i.e., you avoid ratio strain) but accuracy becomes more important in order to maximize contact with reinforcers. (<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22J+Appl+Behav+Anal%22%5Bjour%5D+AND+increasing+the+discriminability">Fisher et al., 2014</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/521431">Koegel, Schreibman, Britten, and Laitinen, 1979</a></strong>). This may also function to increase the saliency between engaging in a given behavior in certain antecedent conditions by spacing opportunities out in time. A short delay (20-30s) following incorrect trials and a reinforcing stimulus following correct trials would create a contingency where the density of reinforcer contact is heavily dependent on accurate responding.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Conclusion</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Stimulus overselectivity is a commonly identified problem in the practice of analysts working with children diagnosed with ASD. While the prevalency of stimulus overselectivity remains unclear, it has been recently estimated at 19% although further information is needed. While there are many treatment approaches available in the literature, it always comes down to each unique learner&#39;s differences. As with everything in behavior analysis, systematic analysis and data collection of a variety of the aforemention procedures may be necessary to identify the ideal intervention for your learner.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The </strong><img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/XPqFbUO.png" style="float:left; height:234px; margin:15px; width:234px" /> <strong>Behavioral Observations Podcast</strong></h2>

<p>This excellent podcast is a little like Sean&#39; Evan&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ">Hot One&#39;s</a> (but with behavior analysis, not chicken wings) infused NPR&#39;s &quot;all things considered&quot; carried out in an engaging, conversational tone. If you&#39;ve ever wanted to hear what leading analysts like <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-20/">Greg Hanley</a>, <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-31-pat-mcgreevy-teaching-functional-skills/">Patrick McGreevy</a>, <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-50-get-your-act-together-with-jonathan-tarbox/">Jonathan Tarbox</a>, <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-45-wayne-fisher-best-practices-functional-analysis-function-based-treatment/">Wayne Fisher</a> (and more!) have to say, this is the spot for thought-provoking interviews with these giants in the field.</p>

<p>Even cooler are with the interviews with folks that people like me might not (but should) know about - some of the most engaging interviews that I&#39;ve enjoyed include <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-17-derek-reed-behavioral-economics/">Derek Reed&#39;s</a> discussion of behavioral economics or <a href="https://behavioralobservations.com/session-51-lets-get-social-with-ashley-rose/">Ashley Rose</a> discussing social skills.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t suggest checking this out once or twice a week. At the time of this writing, there are over 50 episodes - you won&#39;t regret spending time listening to any of them. You can earn CEUs for some episodes, too!</p>

<p>Diana, Jackie, and Rob are the three hosts for a podcast they describe as &quot;like reading while driving... but much safer.&quot; It&#39;s got a lot of humor and silliness, so it kind of comes off like a nerdy, ABA-focused parallel universe version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/breakfastclubpowerfm">breakfast club</a>.</p>

<p>Some episodes involve guest speakers, while others are quite literally the hosts grabbing random research articles from a mystery bag and discussing them in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great podcast to check out if you&#39;re trying to stay current in the field - you can even earn CEUs for listening to the episodes, too, which is pretty cool. And, like their tag-line says, this podcast is way safer than trying to read JABA articles while driving to work.</p>

<p>These podcasts are pretty long, and the content is more unique from the others on the list, such as Dr. Emily Callahan (BCBA-D) discussing organizational health, agency/organization management, and collaboration between large groups of analysts in an interdisciplinary setting. Overall, this was a pretty unique podcast that offers something more for established practitioners rather than students.</p>

INSERT INTO `blog_post` VALUES (7,'Assessing Skills','<p>The behavior analyst is often posed with a unique and tremendously challenging problem: what do I teach my learners? In what order should I teach these skills? Is there a more efficient way to teach this skill? How much will this vary among different types of learners?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For some analysts, this predicament is more severe, depending on the population they work with. In the example of an analyst working with diabetics who refuse to participate in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure#Diet">renal diet</a>, the target behavior(s), interventions, and focus of treatment may still be quite challenging, but the scope of their practice is limited enough that there is no doubt on what they must focus on. For some behavior analysts, however - especially those working with young children with Autism - they may find themselves meeting a child who is clearly <em>behind </em>developmentally speaking when compared to same-aged peers, however, where or what to start teaching may not be as clear.</p>

<p>This is compounded by <strong>two common problems</strong> that practitioners might face while receiving their education:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Behavior analysts are often taught <em>how to teach</em>, and not <em>what to teach</em>, which often leaves us profoundly primed to use the matching law, schedules of reinforcement, DRAs, and all kinds of other things to benefit our clients, but we&#39;re not quite sure what behaviors to work on first</li>
	<li>Behavior Analysts are often given some exposure to skills assessments like the VB-MAPP, ABLLS-R, EFLS, or other such assessment books but limited exposure is given to actually selecting and using them when you&#39;re working with a very diverse group of people such as young kids with autism</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I need to admit that there will be a bias as there often is (at least at the time of this writing) in the field of ABA towards the application of this content towards it&#39;s relevance towards the individuals with Autism. Hopefully, in the future, that will change and we will enjoy broader application of behavior analytic technology to helping people from all walks of life in all kinds of different realms, but for now, here is where we are, so to speak, and autism will be the underlying focus of skills assessment in this blog post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How To Select an Assessment - Objective Criteria</strong></h3>

<p>When you first venture out into the world of selecting assessments, you might be a little overwhelmed. If you use an online data collecting platform, such as CentralReach, you may notice that it asks you to link each skill you target to an assessment. When you click the drop-down menu, you may experience heart-palpitations when you see the littany of choices afforded to you:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HOwl2mw.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; float:left; height:333px; margin:15px; width:349px" /></p>

<p><strong>The list keeps going and going - look how tiny that scroll bar is!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So with all the options available to us, how can we find assessments suitable for the type of population we&#39;re working with and the types of skills we need to teach that population?</p>

But how the heck do you become an RBT?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>First - what is an RBT?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>RBT</strong> stands for <strong><u>R</u>egistered <u>B</u>ehavior <u>T</u>echnician</strong> - a paraprofessional in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behavior analysis</a> who has received a credential from the <a href="https://www.bacb.com/">Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB)</a> to indicate a baseline level of competency at behavioral services delivery.</p>

<p>RBTs often work directly with clients and provide most of the day-to-day service delivery, freeing up analysts to do other work. The <a href="https://www.bacb.com/">BACB</a> describes RBTs as individuals qualified to implement a behavior plan designed by a behavior analyst, but only under the supervision of that analyst or other qualified analysts. The RBT credential was first offered in 2014, and there have been progressive revisions to the RBT process since it&#39;s inception.</p>

<p><strong>The job expectations of an RBT are rigorous</strong>. Some of the individuals that RBTs may work for will exhibit serious or dangerous behavior, and RBTs may work with these individuals for hours at a time.</p>

<p>The technical expectations of the job are numerous, and varied. RBTs may be expected to implement task analyses, assist with functional assessment, implement verbal skills training, and collect &amp; measure behavior before graphing it.</p>

<p>RBTs are required to write session notes, create case notes, and collect accurate data on behaviors of interest. To do this, they may also require some training / experience with basic software, such as using spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) or specialized practice management software.</p>

<p>They are also expected to behave professionally and ethically, sometimes in trying scenarios where the correct choice may not be clear. The Board has <a href="https://www.bacb.com/rbt/rbt-ethics-discipline/"><strong>an ethics code specifically for RBTs</strong></a>.</p>

<p>There has been a massive influx of individuals becoming RBT certified over the past few years. As of this posting in July 2018, there are over 28,000 BCBAs, 3,000 BCaBAs, and 37,000 RBTs registered with the BACB. <strong>As shown on the right, an RBT in 2018 will <u>most likely</u> be working with children or adults with a diagnosis of autism (ASD).</strong> This will likely be the case for awhile as the research in applied behavior analysis continues to investigate applications that may make behavior analysts more effective at serving those with autism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em><u>Common Duties of an RBT</u>:</em></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Working directly with clients receiving behavior analytic services</li>
	<li>Collecting and graphing data</li>
	<li>Receiving supervision from a certified behavior analyst</li>
	<li>Ongoing competency training</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behavior Analysis, as a profession, does not yet offer fully nationally recognized licensure in the US. The BACB, itself, is a recent advent - it was created in 1998 to <span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&quot;<em>protect consumers of behavior analysis services worldwide by systematically establishing, promoting, and disseminating professional standards</em>&quot;</span> (<a href="https://www.bacb.com/about/">BACB</a>). Since it&#39;s inception, the BACB has created various levels of certification to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ensure quality of services delivered</li>
	<li>Minimum competency standards</li>
	<li>Standardize training for analysts</li>
	<li>Protect consumers from the unqualified</li>
</ol>

<p>This is no small task, and over the years, the BACB has imposed increasingly more rigorous requirements on applications for the various certification levels. Many states have adopted licensure, but there are still many states that have not yet made licensure for available for behavior analysts. The different levels of certification offered by the board - RBT, BCaBA, BCBA, BCBA-D - all require different, progressively more difficult, levels of mentorship and an increasingly difficult examination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After you complete the RBT sign up process, you&#39;re now ready to go out and work as an RBT. You will also need to make sure you are behaving ethically, logging your direct care / supervision hours, and doing your best to represent our profession in a positive light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What <em>is</em> Supervision, exactly, and does it hurt?</strong></h3>

<p>Supervision is performance oversight, typically carried out in person (but not always) while you work with your clients implementing their behavior plan(s).</p>

<p>A BCaBA, BCBA, or BCBA-D can supervise you - you can have multiple supervisors, and your supervisors don&#39;t <em>have</em> to be your responsible certificant. You need to have at least one meeting with your responsible certificant per month, unless you have a special arrangement set up within your company (see the <a href="https://www.bacb.com/rbt/responsible-certificants/">Board&#39;s requirements here</a> if you have a special case). You will need to carefully document the number of hours you provide <u>direct care</u> each month with your clients, as well as the number of hours you are supervised. This is important because the board is dedicated to ensuring the competent delivery of behavior analytic service, and adequate, effective supervision is a big part of that. They may audit you randomly or as part of a formal inquiry at your agency, and if your documentation is not up-to-date, you may have your certification revoked.</p>

<p><strong>Supervision is not unique to behavior analysis</strong> - doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists - all of those folks use supervision in their service delivery model as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Per the BACB:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:16px"><q>&nbsp;Each RBT must obtain ongoing supervision for a minimum of 5% of the hours spent providing applied behavior-analytic services per month. Supervision must include at least 2 face-to-face, synchronous contacts per month, during at least one of which the supervisor observes the RBT providing services. In-person, on-site observation is preferred. </q></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supervision consists of a variety of activities, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Performance feedback following direct observation of your work with clients</li>
	<li>Improving your behavior-analytic problem solving</li>
	<li>Reviewing your session / case notes</li>
	<li>Feedback regarding the professionalism, thoroughness, and appropriateness of:
	<ul>
		<li>your response to feedback from supervisiors</li>
		<li>the content of your case / session notes</li>
		<li>your interactions with caregivers and other stakeholders</li>
		<li>any other reports / documentation required by your posting</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Are the outcomes &amp; objectives of your client(s) improving as a result of your behavioral service delivery?</li>
	<li>Are you becoming better, overall, as a behavioral technician?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Maintaining Your Supervision Log</em></h4>

<p><strong>A minimum of 5% of your direct care hours (working with clients) must be supervised by an analyst.</strong> This means that an RBT must be supervised for 2 hours a week if they work full-time (40 hours / week). You must maintain a log to document this, so that in the event that you or your agency are audited, you can provide supporting documentation to attest that you were, in fact, supervised to this minimum requirement as mandated by the board. You can download a copy of the board&#39;s example supervision log <a href="https://www.bacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/160711-RBT-audit-form.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><code><strong>You can download a spreadsheet version of the BACB&#39;s log that automatically calculates (and verifies) your hours for you here: <a href="https://app.box.com/v/rbt-log">https://app.box.com/v/rbt-log</a></strong></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Supervision sounds really scary!</em></h4>

<p>In my experience, a lot of people new to the field may not have encountered supervision prior to working in ABA. Some find it a little stage-fright inducing to have a supervisor quite literally watching you work for what can be hours at a time. Done correctly, supervision is a collaborative process. Supervision is <u>not</u> the time to have your client &quot;be on their best behavior.&quot; Quite the opposite - the purpose of supervision is to evaluate whether a behavior change program is working. If you set your session up to avoid any of your client&#39;s &quot;eggshells&quot; that might evoke problem behavior, you&#39;re doing a disservice to yourself and your client. If your supervisor has designed a program that isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s their job to fix it. If you are implementing the program incorrectly, it&#39;s their job to (politely and professionally) provide you with additional training and assistance. All of this will ensure that your client makes the most efficient progress towards whatever their goals are in the least amount of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Supervisors receive some training on <em>how</em> to supervise, but they may not always be instant gurus at it. Some might even suck at it, frankly speaking. You will encounter many different styles of supervision: some supervisors may sit nearby and quietly observe, taking notes, only providing feedback at the end of the session. Other supervisors may frequently interrupt with feedback while you are working. You may prefer immediate feedback (latter example) or delayed feedback (former example). As different behavior analysts have different supervisory styles (and different levels of efficacy implementing supervision), you may want to provide feedback to your supervisor regarding your preferences regarding receiving feedback and training. By no means does BCBA certification instantly make a person a wonderful supervisor or grant a BCBA with super-human interpersonal skills. You will meet jerks, and you will meet people that will truly grow you professionally. You may even meet a few jerks that make you grow professionally. There exists a continuum of quality when it comes to supervisors, like in any field, and it is your responsibility to advocate for yourself and seek supervisors that will help you become your best. A crucial skill, in any profession, is learning to communicate effectively and with kindness. Should you decide to pursue BCaBA, BCBA, or BCBA-D certification later on, you may find yourself supervising individuals much like yourself right now - so treat others with the same respect and professionalism that you&#39;d like to receive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Still sounds really scary - I hate being watched! It makes me nervous!</em></h4>

<p>As a person with plenty of social anxiety and stage fright, I found supervision pretty intimidating at first, and to an extent, I still do. I think a lot of thoughts when I&#39;m being observed - typically, things like &quot;I should have done ____ better&quot; or &quot;I feel like I&#39;m doing _____ terribly.&quot; You can insert whatever you want into those blanks, I&#39;ve probably had the thought at some point during a service observation. I find it helps to &quot;anchor myself to the moment&quot; or practice <u>mindfulness</u>. That might sound like a lot of hippie mumbo-jumbo, but there&#39;s actually a lot of research and empirical evidence to support it. Mindfulness treats your own thoughts as private verbal behavior that you can shape in the same manner as you might shape any other verbal behavior. I&#39;ve found <strong><a href="https://www.actmindfully.com.au/">Russ Harris&#39;s discussions on <em>mindfulness</em>, <em>defusion</em>, and staying in the moment</a></strong> to be tremendously helpful for me, and if you&#39;re a hyper-caffeineated sociophobe like myself, they might benefit you too. You can read about more about mindfulness, and the branch of behavioral science it stems from (ACT - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</a>) online or by reading some of the research articles by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_C._Hayes">Steven Hayes</a></strong> (he&#39;s also the guy behind <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_frame_theory">RFT</a></strong>, in case you were wondering).</p>

<p>Maybe the strategy of practicing pragmatic mindfulness will be helpful for you in reducing your anxiety during supervision. Maybe just simple <u>practice</u> will desensitize you to the aversiveness of being observed by a supervisor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Are we Preparing RBTs Adequately Enough to Succeed in Behavior Analysis?</em></h4>

<p>Since the introduction of the RBT credential in 2014, tens of thousands of folks have become certified. The introduction of the <strong><a href="https://www.bacb.com/rbt/rbt-exam/">RBT exam</a></strong> made it more difficult to obtain the RBT credential, but many thousands of people have successfully passed the exam. There has been some concern in the behavior analytic community that the requirements to become an RBT are not strict enough. For example, <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459762/">Leaf et al. compared requirements to become a RBT vs requirements to become a LPN</a></strong> (licensed practical nurse). LPNs are comparable entry-level technicians in the medical industry.

<p><strong>The Take Home:</strong> other professions might be doing a better job preparing folks for their jobs than we are doing in behavior analysis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RBTs have a great many duties and responsibilities, ranging from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>implementing verbal skills utilizing elementary verbal operants (mand, tact, intraverbal, etc.)</li>
	<li>managing severe behavior like aggression or SIB</li>
	<li>Assisting with functional assessment procedures</li>
	<li>Collecting and graphing data in various phases (baseline, treatment, maintanence)</li>
	<li>Understanding basic principles of behavior, such as reinforcement and punishment.</li>
	<li>Basic knowledge about the population they serve, such as individuals with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury">TBI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome">Prader-Willi Syndrome</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum">Autism</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can someone master all of these skills with just 40 hours of instruction? It seems like an impossible task, and perhaps the solution, for right now at least, is to commit yourself, as an individual, to continued education, even if you master the &quot;RBT Competency Checklist.&quot; Who wants to be <em>basically competent, </em>anyway? You want to be <em>extremely competent</em>! You want to be the best you can be, and it&#39;s safe to assume 40 hours is insufficient to that task.&nbsp;There has been lots of research that has examined the quality of parent and teacher training packages, but limited research on the success of RBT training packages in terms of preparing individuals to succeed clinically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Even after you pass the RBT Exam, your education should be <u>ongoing</u> and <u>continuous</u> - don&#39;t settle for basic competency. Always strive to improve!</h2>

INSERT INTO `blog_post` VALUES (10,'Motivation Matters','<p>I work typically with children with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and since some of my kids have really long days, I frequently find myself looking for items to motivate the clients I am working with. In the last 10 years, the quality and availability of &quot;reinforcers&quot; has experience a sea change, with the advent of the now ubiquitous iPad. Previously, behavior analysts (and before them, the <em>Behavior Modifiers</em>) were infamous for their over-utilization of edibles - snack foods, like candies, M&amp;Ms, etc. - as reinforcing stimuli.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All this got me thinking - what are people using to motivate their clients in their sessions? Of course, I turned to the research, and I found this neat survey by Graff &amp; Karsten (2012) in <em>Behavior Analysis in Practice</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0Ucnnjc.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Ucnnjc.jpg" style="height:443px; width:735px" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those curious, <strong>the first iPad was released on April 3rd, 2010 </strong>and this study was in 2012. I wonder if they divided the &quot;toy&quot; category into &quot;screen time&quot; vs other types of toys, if there would be a difference of any kind between the BCBAs and the non-BCBA groups. One thing is clear, at least, from the data above - by 2012, behavior analysts are using a lot of varied reinforcement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the behavior analyst working with young clients with autism, motivation is crucial. Many of young children will not respond unless motivational variables are contrived in some highly favorable fashion - natural reinforcers for behavior simply aren&#39;t enough for our clients (otherwise, they might not require the assistance of behavioral therapists!).</p>

Megan Sullivan Kirby and Barbara Kaminski created Uncomfortable BCBA as a platform for them to talk about ethical issues surrounding BCBAs participating in politics as well as ethical quandaries and dillemas indemic to our profession. As stated on their site, the purpose of their blog is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uncomfortable BCBA is a platform for behavior analysts to discuss a wide variety of issues. Regardless of the day-to-day topics of commenting or the pinned blog post, the heart and soul of Uncomfortable BCBA is to encourage our fellow behavior analysts to play a role in positive societal change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As therapists, we may encounter racism, homophobia, clients with uncomfortable political views, you name it. I remember after the 2016 election, which, for those who don&#39;t know (or try to avoid) United States politics, was a controversial event. Our more verbal clients would espouse the view points of their parents, and this caused some uncomfortable moments. Some families even attempted to post political material in our lobby or asked therapists who they wanted to win the election.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uncomfortable BCBA is a platform to talk to other analysts about these issues. It&#39;s a new blog, relatively speaking - they got started in 2017 (like me!!!) but they (unlike me) have spoke at conferences espousing their concerns about diversity training, ethics and politics, and all things uncomfortab.e</p>

INSERT INTO `blog_post` VALUES (16,'Task Analyses, or Recipes for Success!','<h2>What is a task analyses?</h2>

<p>A <strong>task analysis</strong> is used by behavior analysts to break a complicated task down into a more easily accomplishable sequence of smaller, simpler steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Chaining:</strong></h3>

<p>This is typically referred to as a <u>behavior chains</u>: a specific sequence of responses that serve as individual members of a chain; each step serving as the reinforcer for the previous step and signaling the availability of reinforcement for completing the next response in the chain. The last step in the chain contacts the &quot;terminal reinforcer&quot; that maintains the whole chain. The terminal reinforcer for a behavior chain such as &quot;making a sandwich&quot; would be, of course, getting to eat the sandwich!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>It can be helpful to think of task analyses / behavior chains as &quot;recipes&quot; - they&#39;re sort of like &quot;behavioral recipes!&quot; that produce consequences in the environment instead of food (although, of course, sometimes the consequence of our behavior is food).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>General Teaching Strategies</strong></h3>

<p>There are three general methods for teaching a task analysis, each referring to when / how teaching will be organized:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Total or Whole Task Teaching </strong>refers to the teaching all&nbsp;of the steps in a task analysis and providing reinforcement differential to independence on any given step(s) in the task analysis.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Forward Chaining</strong> refers to starting at the initial step of a task analysis and providing prompting / reinforcement until that step is mastered. All subsequent steps are typically &quot;teacher-completed,&quot; i.e., the teacher provides hand-over-hand assistance on all un-mastered steps. When the first step is mastered, the second step is introduced into teaching until all steps are mastered, from start --&gt; finish!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Backwards Chaining</strong> refers to starting at the very last step of a task analysis and providing prompting / reinforcement until that step is mastered, and then introducing the next-to-last step into teaching after that, and so on, until all steps are mastered. The teacher will also complete any steps that are not mastered / currently in teaching. This type of chaining is used frequently when there may be some benefit to having the learner contact the &quot;terminal step&quot; from the get-go: e.g., if your learner likes to run around outside, having them complete only the last step to tying their shoes helps establish a learning history that compliance and completion of the shoe-tying task leads to an awesome time outside on the playground.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Limited Holds</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Limited Holds </strong>are a special type of behavior chain. In behavior chains with <u>limited holds</u>, not only must the steps be performed correctly, but also within a specified period of time to produce the terminal reinforcer. For example, imagine a head chef working at a busy restaurant. In order to produce reinforcement for himself and the other cooks, he must not only complete all the steps necessary to produce a dish, but do so in a reasonable amount of time. If he fails to produce the dishes quickly, the clientele might become angry and leave the restaurant and / or never come back.&nbsp; The limited hold refers to the reinforcer (in this case, satisfaction of the customer) being only available for a limited period of time from the inception of the chain (creating the dish).</p>

<p>Another example could be a factory worker at a Widget factory. In order to satisfy his manager, the factory worker must create 30 widgets / hour. If the factory worker fails to produce the widgets at the required rate, he will not meet his production goal and may anger his boss and lose his job. If, however, he meets his production goal, he may receive a &quot;bonus&quot; to his weekly salary for his hard work. The reinforcement - the &quot;bonus&quot; to his weekly check - is on a limited hold contingent upon the rate of his widget production.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>An Example Task Analysis:</strong></h3>

<p>Back to our original example of a task analysis - making a sandwich; here are some example steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open a bag of bread</li>
	<li>Take two slices out</li>
	<li>Lay them on a plate, side-by-side</li>
	<li>Get the jar of peanut butter</li>
	<li>Get a knife</li>
	<li>Spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread</li>
	<li>Wipe the knife off in the sink, and keep it with you</li>
	<li>Put the jar of peanut butter back</li>
	<li>Get a jar of jelly</li>
	<li>Spread some jelly on the other side of the bread</li>
	<li>Wipe the knife off in the sink and put it on the dry rack</li>
	<li>Put the two sandwich slices together</li>
	<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p>In the task analysis above, you might notice that some of the steps (such as steps 4 - 10) can be completed in a different order and still achieve the same effect. For instance, you could absolutely put the jelly on before the peanut butter. However, it would make little sense to do step 12 before doing steps 2 - 10. Sometimes, the&nbsp;<strong>logical order</strong>&nbsp;of the steps may be&nbsp;<u>insensitive</u>&nbsp;to change (that is, you can mix them up), or it may be&nbsp;<u>sensitive</u>&nbsp;to change (that is to say if you mix them up, the terminal reinforcer will change in quality or be unavailable).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How do you build a task analysis?</strong></h3>

<p>Generally, there are three ways one could create a task analysis.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Observe a competent performer:</strong> observe and describe each discrete step a competent performer makes while engaging in a task analysis</li>
	<li><strong>Ask an Expert:</strong> if you can&#39;t or don&#39;t have the opportunity to perform the task, ask someone experience with completing the task to write the steps down for you. In keeping with our &quot;recipe&quot; metaphor, a competent performer might be an experience chef. You might not have the resources (money, time) to practice baking a dish and, instead, might prefer to just ask an expert chef to do it for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Do it yourself:</strong> Same as #1, except, you do it yourself, pausing to write each step down as you see fit. It can be trickier to do this in some cases because pausing to interrupt the chain may be impractical in some circumstances.</li>
</ol>
